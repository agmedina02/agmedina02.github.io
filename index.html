            <p>I’m currently a junior at the University Florida pursing a bachelor’s degree in journalism with a minor in anthropology and history. Hailing from a small town in the panhandle of Florida and having the opportunity to travel the world for most of my life, I take pride in my ability to adapt easily into my surroundings and interact with whoever may make that place thrive all with charm*.</p>

            I’ve always had a fascination with how people tick, so much so my mother had to remind me quite a few times as a child to stop staring at strangers because I was so lost in my thoughts about the actions of others. This is why I’m a journalist today. I get the honor to listen and learn from some of the most interesting people in our world to inform and inspire action on others.

            My greatest passion lies in /I have a mad passion for the world of fashion. Fashion truly is a universal language that and I hope developing my journalistic skills in areas such as social media, photography and video editing will push me closer to eventually writing or blogging for a fashion magazine.
