            <p>When I'm not busy with schoolwork, I like to take a break by dancing hip hop for an organization on campus called Dancin' Gators. It's a fun form of exercise for me and helps to clear my mind of the clutter that I may have accumilated throughout the week.   </p>

            It's probably not a surprise that as a jouralism major that I love to read anything I can get my hands on whether it's a magazine or one of my favorite young adult novels. Even during my free time I'm still writing, though it's usually in the form of a short story or written letter to relative. 
            </p>

            If I'm feeling especially creative I break out my art supplies from their hidden place to start a new do it yourself project. I'm fairly new to this world and I usally get most of my ideas from <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/anagmedina/">Pinterest </a> or watching one of my favorite vloggers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCywvIZ1g97Z-2E_nFe4Q5VA">YouTube</a>. Most of my creations are usually made for my friends or family. 
                 </p>
            
            <p>
            If I'm not doing any of those activities above then you'll more than likely find me at the nearest mall dreaming of a purse I'll never be able to afford or anywhere there is free food.
